# Crazy Chat Overlay

> This is the result of a little library I found called [tmi.js](https://github.com/tmijs). It allows you to connect to a Twitch stream chat and get all of the messages, live 😁

The goal of this repository is to make a simple website where you can customize the look of your on screen Twitch chat. More features to come! _Hopefully soon_
